# CS 512: Computer Vision  

## Course Overview  
Taught by **Gady Agam**, this course focuses on fundamental topics in **computer vision** and the application of **deep neural networks** in this field. The course consists of **six assignments and two exams**.  

## Main Topics  
- **Geometric Image Formation**: 3D scene projects onto a 2D image  
- **Feature Extraction**: Identify and isolate meaningful attributes or patterns  
- **Object Detection**  
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Divide the image into meaningful regions  
- **Camera Calibration**  
- **Epipolar Geometry**  
- **Model Reconstruction**  
- **Motion Estimation**  

We also learned about **CNN, R-CNN, YOLO, U-Net**, and related **deep learning frameworks**.  

## **Directory Structure**  

### **Assignment**  
Contains solutions for all assignments:  

- **Zero Assignment**: Focuses on algebra, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and neural network concepts.  
- **First Assignment**: Coordinates representations, manual transformations (affine, inverse, etc.), transformations using OpenCV, and a general camera model.  
- **Second Assignment**: Implement convolution filters and other filters (Gaussian smoothing, Gaussian pyramid, Gaussian derivatives, Laplacian of Gaussian).  
- **Third Assignment**: Robust estimation and image classification (binary and multiclass) using CNNs and ResNet.  
- **Fourth Assignment**: Train a CNN with skip connections for segmentation masks and object detection using YOLO.  
- **Fifth Assignment**: Train VGG16 and ViT (Vision Transformer) models and integrate them to enhance results.  

### **Exam**  
Contains **cheatsheets** and **problems** used to study for exams.  

### **Lecture**  
Contains my **class notes** for each slide and additional annotations.  

### **Project**  
Our project proposes an **automated method** for classifying **melanoma images** as **benign or malignant** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The goal is to assist **dermatologists in early diagnosis**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **CNN, ResNet, YOLO, VGG16, ViT**  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks** (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
