CS 512: Computer Vision

Taught by Gady Agam, this course focus on fundamental topics in computer vision and the application of deep neural networks to this area. This course is composed by six assignments and two exams.

Main topics:
Geometric image formation (3D scene projects onto a 2D image)
Feature extraction (identify and isolate meaningful attributes or patterns)
Object detection 
Semantic segmentation (divide the image into meaningful regions)
Camera calibration
Epipolar geometry
Model reconstruction
Motion estimation

We also learned about CNN, R-CNN, YOLO, U-Net, and related deep learning frameworks.

Description of directories:

-Assignment: Contains my solutions for all assignments. 
	-Zero Assignment: Focuses on algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and neural networks concepts.
	-First Assignment: Focuses on coordinates representations, manual transformations (affine, inverse...) or transformations using OpenCV, and general camera model.
	-Second Assignment: Implement the convolution filter, and other filters (Gaussian smoothing, Gaussian pyramid, Gaussian derivatives, Laplacian of Gaussian...).
	-Third Assignment: Focuses on robust estimation and image classification (binary and multiclass) using CNNs and Resnet.
	-Fourth Assignment: Train a CNN with skip connections to get the segmentation mask and object detection using YOLO. 
	-Fifth Assignment: Train VGG16 and ViT (Standard Vision Transformer) models and their integration to enhance their results.

-Exam: Contains cheatsheet and problems used to study the exams.

-Lecture: Contains my notes for each slide and my class annotations.

-Project: Our projects proposes an automated method for classifying melanoma images as benign or malignant using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with the goal of assisting dermatologists in early diagnosis.
